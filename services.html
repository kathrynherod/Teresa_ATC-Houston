                                        Initially developed in the turn of the 20th century, today play

therapy refers to a large number of treatment methods, all applying

the therapeutic benefits of play. Play therapy differs from regular

play in that the therapist helps children to address and resolve their

own problems. Play therapy builds on the natural way that children

learn about themselves and their relationships in the world around

them (Axline, 1947; Carmichael, 2006; Landreth, 2002). Through

play therapy, children learn to communicate with others, express

feelings, modify behavior, develop problem-solving skills, and

learn a variety of ways of relating to others. Play provides a safe

psychological distance from their problems and allows expression

of thoughts and feelings appropriate to their development.

                                        Play is a fun, enjoyable activity that elevates our spirits and

brightens our outlook on life. It expands self-expression, self-

knowledge, self-actualization and self-efficacy. Play relieves

feelings of stress and boredom, connects us to people in a positive

way, stimulates creative thinking and exploration, regulates our

emotions, and boosts our ego (Landreth, 2002). In addition, play

allows us to practice skills and roles needed for survival.

                                    Children are referred for play therapy to resolve their problems

(Carmichael; 2006; Schaefer, 1993). Often, children have used up

their own problem solving tools, and they misbehave, may act out

at home, with friends, and at school (Landreth, 2002). Play therapy

allows trained mental health practitioners who specialize in play

therapy, to assess and understand children's play. Further, play

therapy is utilized to help children cope with difficult emotions and

find solutions to problems.

There is another credential that play therapists in the United States can achieve called the Registered Play Therapist (RPT).  This credential is provided through the Association for Play Therapy.  It requires the play therapist to have at least a master's degree and license in a mental health field, to complete a substantial amount of play therapy training, to have extensive clinical experience, and to have received play therapy supervision.

                                        It is a form of expressive therapy. Sandtray Therapy allows a person to construct his or

her own story using miniature figures and sand. The story created can be a reflection of

the person’s own life and allows them to resolve conflicts, remove obstacles, and gain

acceptance of self.

                                        This type of therapy is often used with children, but can be applied to adults, teens,

couples, families, and groups as well. Many children are unable to verbalize emotional

states, particularly in the face of trauma, neglect, or abuse. This method of therapy serves

as a valuable and powerful outlet for children and an incredibly insightful method of

gaining access to traumatic experiences.

                                            The non-verbal nature of Sandtray Therapy and the familiar medium of sand can help

children achieve feelings of comfort and security. With little instruction from the

therapist, the child is free to play and develop his or her own expression of situations.

Often the children will experience a sense of independent play and will begin making

assumptions and behavior changes without cues from the therapist.</p>

                                        Theraplay® provides techniques for children and families to create relationships that are based on nurturing and trust. The joy that play brings to children is also brought into the parent child relationship.</p>

                                        Theraplay® focuses on four central parent/child connection areas:

nurture, structure, engagement, and challenge. Attachment and

trust between parent and child are built through activities that

encourage a secure bond for the child with the caregiver. Through

play children are able to build self-esteem, trust, become more

regulated, and connect with others in a meaningful and authentic

way. Healing from trauma can be healed with techniques that are

used allowing children and their families to reconnect with a safe

and secure attachment. Theraplay can be especially beneficial for

foster/adopt families.

                                        EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a

psychotherapy that enables people to heal from the symptoms and

emotional distress that are the result of disturbing life experiences. 

Repeated studies show that by using EMDR people can experience

the benefits of psychotherapy that once took years to make a

difference.</p>

                                        EMDR therapy shows that the mind can in fact heal from

psychological trauma much as the body recovers from physical

trauma.  When you cut your hand, your body works to close the

wound.  If a foreign object or repeated injury irritates the wound, it

festers and causes pain.  Once the block is removed, healing

resumes.  EMDR therapy demonstrates that a similar sequence of

events occurs with mental processes.  The brain’s information

processing system naturally moves toward mental health.  If the

system is blocked by the impact of a disturbing event, the

emotional wound festers and can cause intense suffering.  Once the

block is removed, healing resumes.  Using the detailed protocols

and procedures learned in EMDR training sessions, clinicians help

clients activate their natural healing processes.

                                        It is a unique form of therapy in which a small number of people meet together

once a week in order to learn new behavioral skills. During this time, members

learn strategies to help them successfully achieve the goals of the group. It has

been a common practice for 50 years and has been proven to be very effective.</p>

develop theirs as well. They are able to “role play” with peers the strategies they are

learning. It is also helpful to become aware that others their age are also struggling

with emotional issues. Groups are small and limited to 6 children with similar

emotional behavioral concerns and close in age.
